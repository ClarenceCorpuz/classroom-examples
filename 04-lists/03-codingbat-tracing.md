# Codingbat Solution Tracing
This is a collection of [Codingbat](http://codingbat.com) solutions that may or may not work. 
The idea is to trace the code to discover the errors or to determine if the solution is infact correct.

## Adding a post
Simply edit this document and add your code as shown below with the following rules:
1. Ensure your code is within triple backticks like below. 
2. Add [type annotations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) for the function header so we know what type of data the function recieves and returns.
3. Ensure that the name of the function is under an appropriate `###` header.
4. Ensure that the problem's explanation text is above all the "solutions". 
5. Keep the problems in alpha order.

## Example:
### double
Create a function that will double the given integer.
```
double(5) -> 10
double(3) -> 6
double(0) -> 0
```
Solutions:

```python
def double(n: int) -> int:
    return n * 2
```

```python
def double(n: int) -> int:
    return n * 1
```

End example

### maxEnd3

Given an array of ints length 3, figure out which is larger, 
the first or last element in the array, and set all the other 
elements to be that value. Return the changed array.
```
max_end3([1, 2, 3]) â†’ [3, 3, 3]
max_end3([11, 5, 9]) â†’ [11, 11, 11]
max_end3([2, 11, 3]) â†’ [3, 3, 3]
```
Solutions:

```python
def max_end3(nums):
  if nums[0] > nums[2]:
    nums[2] = nums[0]
    nums[1] = nums[0]
  elif nums[2] > nums[0]:
    nums[0] = nums[2]
    nums[1] = nums[2]
  else:
    nums[1] = nums[0]
  return nums
  ```
