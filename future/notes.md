# Job Requirements
- Use of GIT or version control
- Able to write clean, organized code
- Able to follow established coding style guidelines
- Linux skills
- JIRA/Confluence/Trello/**GitHub Project Boards** (project management/bug tracking software)
- Code reviews


# Coding Club
- Can someone show where Waterloo or another university recommends you take the **senior** CCC?


# Code Review
Can be done:
- in groups, on tv/projectors
- through GitHub

Need formal and informal process

Topics:
- Readability
- Conventions/Style guidelines
- Alternative approaches
- Optimizations

# Project Based
Groups of 5
- Set up GitHub
    - Accept assignment on GitHub classroom.
    - Team lead creates the group, the others join it.
- Create a "project" in the repository
    - Select "Automated Kanban" template
    - Create user stories
    - Create product backlog
    - Create sprint backlog

## Teacher interaction
- Broadcast Issues to assignment repos as assignment requirements
    - Reference issue # in commits.

## Assessment
Columns for:
- periodic checkins
- student use of GitHub
    - Tally student interactions on various features:
        - issues
            - use of proper vocabulary
            - ability to explain code and when to use various programming constructs
        - pull requests
        - commits and good commit messages

Iterative process
1. Analysis
2. Plan
3. Code
4. Test
5. Deploy
6. Feedback
7. Repeat

## Issues
### The Eager Beaver
- How to prevent one eager coder from completing an entire project?
- How to limit them and still make the project meaningful?

*Potential Solutions*
- The Project lead.
    - Their job is architecture and bringing all contributer's code together.
    - bring the team through the project.
    - assign members to particular functions
    - coach other members
    - Problem: What if there are multiple high-level per group?

### Individual roadblocks

How does the team deal with an individual holding up the progress?
- Incentive for experts to help the noobs or the struggling.

# Schedule
- Two-week sprints
    - Lessons
    - Exercises
    - Project
        - Use of tools
    - [Code review](#code-review)
    - Evaluation

# Class Repo
- Groups of 5 will fork the main repo
    - Students will move around groups over the semester according to need.
- Students responsible for collaboration on:
    - Content text-book/notes
    - [Coding for Life](#coding-for-life)
    - [Coding problems](#coding-problems)
        - Tests for coding problems
    - [Software Products](#software-products)
- Use of **issues** for:
    - Help on problems
    - Incorrect notes/code
- Use of **project board**:
    - Project: Textbook/notes
    - Project: Individual Lesson progress
    - Project: Individual problem progress
- Use of **pull requests** (to main repo) to submit textbook/notes.
- Use of **pull requests** (to fork) to do code intra-group review.
    - Pull request to main repo to do inter-group code review.

# Coding for Life
Figure out how you can use what you know about programming to automate things or help with daily tasks.

- Homework in various subjects
- Step-by-step instructions
- Tracking items/inventory

# Software Products
- Functional clones of existing apps/software 

# Coding Problems
- Functional
- Pytest to validate programs


# Git in Terminal
Commits on the school image post the author as `robuntu`. Students have to change the local git
name and email on a per-repository basis.

```sh
git config user.email "you@example.com"
git config user.name "Your Name"
```
